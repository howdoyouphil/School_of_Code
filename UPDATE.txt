So I have been pondering the issue, and I think my best approch is to keep pushing my attempts to github repository
By doing this I can see on my actual mobile if the edits have worked as it will be running on a live site rather than 
the editor. 

So just a heads up, my next few pushes might be.. not great.. but I will keep on 'till I have a finished product :)

(I did think of creating a new branch, but then it won't show on the live page. And I also thought of cloning the repo 
again and creating a new page, but then if you wanted to check my progress then the information wouldn't all be there.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Turns out my last update actually made everything look worse :(

I am not sure why that's happened it all looked alright on the 'inspect' mode mobile 

I am aware of the error and will look at it when I get back from work

Hey School of Code folk! 

So making my page responsive has been a bit of a challenge, my initial page has been coded in a way that I 
couldn't think of an easy way to fix it. (I know that there might be a way and I might have over complicated 
the situation but here is the route that I am taking to solve it.)

Firstly, I re-wrote parts of the HTML and CSS into a new file for each (bad practice I know but all in the name of 
learning), so I had one file that would show a 'website friendly' version and one that is 'mobile friendly' version. 
Then wrote a line of JS to check the display screen size then run the correct files depending on device.

I then went to merge it with my main branch but was not sure how the end result would turn out, so I created a clone 
of this repo  called (clone_School_of_code) and tried it.. However it didn't seem to work as intended!

Being that my approach to fixing it is considered bad practice anyway I didn't feel it was worth committing time to
finding a "correct" solution to an already flawed answer to my problem so I have started fixing the problem correctly!

What I have done is I followed a tutorial for creating a responsive email (https://github.com/howdoyouphil/responsive-email.github.io)
which is working as a responsive method which I will now start integrating the methods into my tribute page.

This might take me a little time (and I am feeling time conscious) as it will probably involve me re-writing the code for
my tribute page so I thought I would  just let you know of the steps that I am taking and it is not just being ignored.


Kind regards,

Phil
